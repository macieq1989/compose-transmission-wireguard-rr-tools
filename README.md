## WireGuard VPN providers

Here is a list of WireGuard VPN providers. I've chosen to only list providrs what have a maximum of 2 major concerns over at [safetydetectives.com](http://safetydetectives.com/best-vpns/#simple), these concerns can not be security related. I receive no commission for linking to these providers. Personally I have only tested Mullvad, which are a great provider, so I can't speak for the others. Read about them and make up your own decision.

**Note:** Some of these provider allow port forwarding by using NAT-PMP. To enable this in a Docker container, use this Docker mod:
https://github.com/jordanpotter/docker-mods

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/SebDanielsson/compose-transmission-wireguard.git`
2. Edit `wg0.conf` (WireGuard) with credentials from your VPN provider.
3. Edit `transmission.env` and add your preferred username and password to access the WebUI. Also change  peerport to a port that is open at your VPN provider.
4. `docker compose up -d` and you should be up and running.
5. The Transmission WebUI is accessible at 127.0.0.1:9091. I highly recommend to use a VPN to access your WebUI remotely.

### Allow local access

If your wg0.conf is configured to route all traffic through the VPN server you'll need to add a route to open up for local access. In the following example, local access from the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 is allowed. Adjust the addresses according to your network. The address 172.100.0.1 is the address of the Docker network bridge.

```ini
PostUp = ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 172.100.0.1;
PreDown = ip route delete 192.168.1.0/24;
```

### Extra killswitch

Update `bind-address-ipv4` and `bind-address-ipv6` in Transmission's `settings.json` to the IP addresses that you were provided in your 
`wg0.conf`.

### Themes

[linuxserver/docker-transmission](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-transmission) no longer bundles 3rd party themes. If you want a more powerful UI than the default I'd recommend installing [Transmissionic](https://github.com/6c65726f79/Transmissionic). See the note below from the maintainer:

> ## Changes Required!
> 
> This image no longer bundles 3rd party Transmission UI packages.
> 
> You will need to either remove the TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME environment variable
> from your container or source a UI package yourself and update the path to match.
> 
> We would advise you to use subfolders under /config to store your UI packages
> so that they survive upgrades.
